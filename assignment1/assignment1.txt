1) The "lb" instruction with the format '$rs, imm' is a pseudo instruction.
The two machine codes that are used to achieve it's function are: "lui $rs, 4097"
and "lb $rs, offset(base)".

2) The value of register $t3 after the 'add $t3, $t2, $t3' line is 0x00000026 or 38.
This is because the value of $t3 is set to the value of $t0 + $t1, which 
is set to be 6 + 12 = 18. Then the value of $t3 is set to $t3 + $t2, which evaluates
to 18 + 20 = 38. 

3) The value of of the first command of the .text segment is stored at this address.
???

4) 
5) Without the 'syscall' instruction, the assembler will not not when to end 
execution, and will attempt to execute lines that do not have instructions. leading
to an error or exception being thrown.
