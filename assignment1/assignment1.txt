PART 1:
1) The "lb" instruction with the format '$rs, imm' is a pseudo instruction.
The two machine codes that are used to achieve it's function are: "lui $rs, 4097"
and "lb $rs, offset(base)".

2) The value of register $t3 after the 'add $t3, $t2, $t3' line is 0x00000026 or 38.
This is because the value of $t3 is set to the value of $t0 + $t1, which 
is set to be 6 + 12 = 18. Then the value of $t3 is set to $t3 + $t2, which evaluates
to 18 + 20 = 38. 

3) The value of stored at this location is '3c'. If we were to convert this to an ascii
character, it would be the "<" character. 

4) The value of the label "Str" is stored at memory location 0x10010004, in the
last two positions of the memory. The address reads "0x44434241", but our "A" 
character is the last two digits of the hex number - That is, 41, which corresponds
to the Ascii character for A, which is 0x41.

5) Without the 'syscall' instruction, the assembler will not not when to end 
execution, and will attempt to execute lines that do not have instructions. leading
to an error or exception being thrown. 

PART 2:

1) The program's ouput was no as desired. When printing the string at location message, the 
program would print the entire conents of the .data block. Including the second ascii sring
at location exra. The solution to this error was to change the type of message from .ascii
to .asciiz. This adds a termination character to the end of the sring, allowing the proper 
output to be generated.
